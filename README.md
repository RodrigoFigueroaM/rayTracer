A python implementation for a ray Tracer.
This is a very simple ray tracer that supports:
- [x] Ray-Sphere intersection
- [x] Ray-Triangle Intersection
- [x] Point Light
- [x] Shadows
- [x] Reflection
- [ ] Refraction
- [ ] Ray-Polygon Intersection
- [ ] Intersecting a Group of Objects
- [ ] Ray-Box intersection
- [ ] Ray-Cylinder intersection

## Libraries
- PyQt5
- PyEngine (https://github.com/RodrigoFigueroaM/pyEngine)

### Note:
ppm images are very huge so i'll be using a ppm to jpg converter to display output images
### How to execute program:
1) cd into any of the directory and run
```sh
$ python main.py
```
2) output file under the name output.ppm
