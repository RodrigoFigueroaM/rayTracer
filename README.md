# rayTracer
A python implementation for a ray Tracer.
This is a very simple ray tracer that supports:
- [x] Ray-Sphere intersection
- [x] Ray-Triangle Intersection
- [x] Point Light
- [x] Shadows
- [x] Reflection
- [x] Refraction
- [x] Ray-Plane Intersection
- [ ] Anti-aliasing
- [ ] Load and intersect different models
- [ ] Ray-Box intersection
- [ ] Ray-Cylinder intersection


## Example output

## Libraries
- PyQt5

### Note:
ppm images are very huge so i'll be using a ppm to jpg converter to display output images
### How to execute program:
1) cd into any of the directory and run
```sh
$ python main.py
```
2) output file under the name output.ppm
